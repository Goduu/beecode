# Html document structure

## Introduction

HTML is a markup language that is used to create the structure of a web page. It is the foundation of all web pages and is used to define the structure of a web page. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is not a programming language, but a markup language that defines the structure of your content.

In this unit, we will learn about the basic structure of an HTML document.

## Basic structure of an HTML document

An HTML document is composed of the following elements:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML.
- `<html>`: This element is the root element of an HTML page.
- `<head>`: This element contains meta-information about the document, such as the title of the page, links to stylesheets, and scripts.
- `<title>`: This element specifies the title of the document.
- `<body>`: This element contains the content of the document, such as text, images, links, and other elements.

Here is an example of a basic HTML document structure:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My First Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text on my web page.</p>
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
  </body>
</html>
```

In the example above, we have a basic HTML document with a title, a heading, a paragraph of text, and a link to another website.
