## Whitespace

In JavaScript, whitespace refers to any character that is used to separate characters in the code. It includes spaces, tabs, and line breaks.
Whitespace is used to make the code more readable and easier to understand.
JavaScript ignores whitespace when executing code, so you can use as much whitespace as you like without affecting the functionality of the code.

For example, the following code snippets are equivalent:

```javascript
let x = 5
```

```javascript
let x = 5
```

## Line Breaks

In JavaScript, a line break is used to separate lines of code.
A line break is also known as a line terminator.
JavaScript uses the following characters as line terminators:

- Line Feed (LF): `\n`
- Carriage Return (CR): `\r`
- Line Feed + Carriage Return (CRLF): `\r\n`

For example, the following code snippet uses a line break to separate two statements:

```javascript
let x = 5
let y = 10
```

## Indentation

Indentation is the practice of adding spaces or tabs at the beginning of a line of code to make it easier to read and understand.
Indentation is not required in JavaScript, but it is considered good practice to use indentation to make your code more readable.

For example, the following code snippet uses indentation to make the code more readable:

```javascript
if (x > 0) {
  if (y > 0) {
    console.log("x and y are positive")
  } else {
    console.log("x is positive but y is not")
  }
  console.log("x is positive")
} else {
  console.log("x is not positive")
}
```

Mark the difference of readability between the following code snippets:

```javascript
if (x > 0) {
  if (y > 0) {
    console.log("x and y are positive")
  } else {
    console.log("x is positive but y is not")
  }
  console.log("x is positive")
} else {
  console.log("x is not positive")
}
```

## Reserved Words

Reserved words are words that have a special meaning in JavaScript and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.).
Reserved words are also known as keywords.

Some examples of reserved words in JavaScript are:

```javascript
;-`const` -
  `continue` -
  `default` -
  `delete` -
  `do` -
  `else` -
  `export` -
  `for` -
  `function` -
  `if` -
  `import` -
  `in` -
  `let` -
  `return` -
  `switch`
```

## Strict Mode

Strict mode is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to place a program or a function in a strict operating context.
Strict mode helps you write cleaner, more secure code by catching common coding errors and enforcing stricter rules.

To enable strict mode in JavaScript, you can add the following statement at the beginning of your code:

```javascript
"use strict"
```

For example, the following code snippet uses strict mode:

```javascript
"use strict"

x = 5 // This will cause an error
```

## Unicode

Unicode is a standard for encoding characters in different writing systems.
JavaScript uses Unicode to represent characters in strings and identifiers.

For example, the following code snippet uses Unicode to represent the Greek letter "Ω":

```javascript
let omega = "\u03A9"
console.log(omega) // Output: Ω
```
