The console is a tool that developers use to log information to the browser's console. This information can be used to debug code, track the flow of a program, and more.

The console can help you understand what your code is doing.
There are many categories that you can output your data to, such as `log`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `table`.


Example:

```js
const foo = { name: 'foo', age: 10 };
console.log(foo);
```
The output will be:

```text
{ name: 'foo', age: 10 }
```

There are many levels of logging that you can use to orginize your data logs. Here are some examples:

```js
console.log('log');
console.info('info');
console.warn('warn');
console.error('error');
console.table([{ name: 'foo', age: 10 }, { name: 'bar', age: 20 }]);
```

We can also style our logs using CSS:

```js
console.log(
    '%cHello World',
    'color: blue; font-size: 20px'
 );
```

It should change the color of Hello World to blue and increase the font size to 20px.
