JavaScript is a programming language that is used to make web pages interactive. 
It is a high-level, interpreted language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. 
JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used to enhance web pages in a variety of ways. 

## Variables

Variables are used to store data values.
We can declare a variable using the `var` keyword, but from ECMAScript6 (ES6 / JavaScript 2015) we are encouraged to use `let` and `const` instead.

```js
var x = 3;
let y = 5; // y can be reassigned
const z = 7; // z cannot be reassigned
```

## Statements and declaration

A statement is a command that performs an action.
JavaScript statements are composed of keywords, expressions, operators, and comments.
We can group the statements in categories. 

Some control flow statements:

```text
return
if...else
switch
try...catch
```

Iterations statements:

```text
for
while
do...while
```
Jump statements:

```text
break
continue
```

A declaration, like the names says, is a statement that declares a variable.

Example of declaration statements: 

```text
const
let
function
async function
import 
export
class
```

## Comments

Comments are used to explain code and make it more readable.
JavaScript supports single-line '//' and multi-line comments '/* */'.

```js
// This is a single-line comment

/*
This is a multi-line comment
*/
```

## Naming conventions

Following a standard naming convention is important to make the code more readable and maintainable.
The most common naming conventions are camelCase and snake_case. 
JavaScript variables are case-sensitive.

```js
let myVariable = 5; // camelCase
let my_variable = 5; // snake_case
```

You will most often find camelCase in a JavaScript code.

Here are some must-follow rules when naming variables:

- The first character must be a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($).
- Subsequent characters can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.

Some good practices to follow:
- Use meaningful names.
```js
// bad
let value = 25;
// good
let age = 25;
```

- Use camelCase for variable names.
```js
// bad
let usertype = 'admin';
// bad
let USERtype = 'admin';
// good
let userType = 'admin';
```

- Boolean values starting with 'is' or 'has' helps to distinguish from other values.
```js
let isUserLoggedIn = true;
let hasPermission = false;
```
