  description: "There is a mistake in the following code. Identify the error and correct it."
  codeSnippet: |
    if (chute = numeroSecreto) {
        alert('You guessed correctly!');
    } else {
        alert('You guessed wrong :(');
    }
  expectedOutput: "If the user's guess matches numeroSecreto, they should see 'You guessed correctly!', otherwise 'You guessed wrong :('."
  correctAnswer: |
    The error is in the condition. The single equals sign `=` is used for assignment, not comparison. It should be `==` or `===`.
    Corrected code:
    ```javascript
    if (chute == numeroSecreto) {
        alert('You guessed correctly!');
    } else {
        alert('You guessed wrong :(');
    }
    ```
