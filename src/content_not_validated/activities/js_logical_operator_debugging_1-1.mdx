  type: Debugging
  description: "Identify and correct the mistake in the following code that uses logical operators to determine if a user qualifies for a discount. The user should receive a discount if they are a member and have made a purchase or if they have a coupon code."
  codeSnippet: |
    let isMember = false;
    let madePurchase = true;
    let hasCouponCode = false;

    if (isMember && madePurchase || hasCouponCode) {
        console.log("Você qualifica para um desconto!");
    } else {
        console.log("Você não qualifica para um desconto.");
    }
  expectedOutput: "The current condition will incorrectly give a discount if the user has a coupon code, regardless of their membership or purchase status."
  correctAnswer: |
    Issue: The current condition will incorrectly give a discount if the user has a coupon code, regardless of their membership or purchase status.
    Correction: Use parentheses to group conditions properly: `(isMember && madePurchase) || hasCouponCode`.
    Corrected Code:
    ```javascript
    let isMember = false;
    let madePurchase = true;
    let hasCouponCode = false;

    if ((isMember && madePurchase) || hasCouponCode) {
        console.log("Você qualifica para um desconto!");
    } else {
        console.log("Você não qualifica para um desconto.");
    }
    ```
