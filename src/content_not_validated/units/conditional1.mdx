Conditionals are used to make decisions in code. 

For that we can use the `if...else` statement
If a condition is truthy the if block will be triggered, and the else block of code if the condition is falsy.

Example:

```js
const age = 20;
if(age > 18) {
    console.log('You are an adult');
} else {
    console.log('You are a minor');
}
```
The output will be the if block because the age is bigger then 18.:
```text
You are an adult
```

### Nested `if...else` statements
We can also nest `if...else` statements to create more complex conditions:
```js
const age = 20;
const name = 'John';
if(age > 18) {
    if(name === 'John') {
        console.log('You are an adult named John');
    } else {
        console.log('You are an adult');
    }
} else {
    console.log('You are a minor');
}
```

### Truthy and Falsy values
In JavaScript, a truthy value is a value that is considered true when encountered in a Boolean context.
All values are truthy unless they are defined as falsy.
The following values are always falsy:
```text
  - false
  - 0 (zero)
  - '' or "" (empty string)
  - null
  - undefined
  - NaN (Not a Number)
```
